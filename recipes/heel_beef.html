        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 red pepper</li>

        <li>4 potatos</li>
        <li>500ml of meath broth</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat the disc over medium heat and add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil.
            Place the ossobuco on the disc and sear on both sides until the meat is browned,
            approximately 3-4 minutes per side. Remove and reserve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add a little more oil if necessary. Add the onions, bell pepper, carrot and garlic.
            Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are golden brown.
        </li>
        <li>Put the osso buco back on the disk. Deglaze with the white wine and let the alcohol evaporate for 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Add the tomato preserve and mix well. Then, add the meat broth, ensuring that the
            liquid partially covers the meat and vegetables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt, pepper, rosemary and bay leaf to taste. Cover the disc and cook
            over low heat for 1.5 to 2 hours, making sure it does not run out of liquid.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 30 minutes of cooking, add the sliced ​​potatoes around the meat. Cover again
            and continue cooking until the potatoes are tender, about 45-60 minutes more.
        </li>
    </ol>
